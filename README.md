# wordle_project

Hi folks! 

Welcome to a wordle project I created with the help of ChatGTP. 

By using ChatGTP 3.5, an english word module, and some edit to the wordle code, I was able to create wordle in python. Please import all necessary modules to run the program. 

Here are the wordle rules below:
- You have to guess the Wordle in six goes or less.
- Every word you enter must be in the word list. ...
- A correct letter turns green.
- A correct letter in the wrong place turns yellow.
- An incorrect letter turns gray.
- Letters can be used more than once.
- Answers are never plurals.
